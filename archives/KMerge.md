## Obsolescence

**KMerge is dead !**.

This program was developed for KDE 1 and was never ported to KDE2, KDE3
or KDE4! However, KDE 3 features another program, Kompare, that is far
more beautiful and features part of what KMerge could do.

If you are looking for a good diff/merge program, you can look at the
following:

-   [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sf.net) (windows and KDE versions)
-   [WinMerge](http://winmerge.sf.net) (windows only)
-   kompare, redistributed with [KDE](http://www.kde.org)

## Program

Kmerge is an utility to handle diffing and merging of files or
directories. It also deals with CVS conflicts and will perhaps handle
other type of conflicts (diff3, patch).

Kmerge is distributed under the Gnu GPL and requires [Qt 1.44](http://www.trolltech.com)
and [KDE 1](http://www.kde.org) and Gnu diff.

The current version is 0.4 and it supports file diffing and merging,
directory diffing and merging, cvs conflicts handling at file or
directory level. KMerge is now usable and the next step before release
will be mainly gui enhancing and port to KDE 2.

## Features

-   file diffing
-   file merging
-   directory diffing
-   directory merging
-   customized diff options
-   file pattern exclusion
-   cvs conflicts handling

## History

A lot of programs today have many version developped at the same time
and by many users. Developpers often need to synchronise everything.
Although I found a lot of programs and IDE doing files and directories
diffing, the only thing I could find to do interactive merging and
patching was sdiff and the e-diff mode of emacs. The first is VERY
primitive (although sufficicent for simple file merging) and the second
is quite good but reserved to emacs-user (and I use vim).

So I decided to start kmerge. That was a good opportunity to learn KDE
and Qt. I was inspired by kdiff, sdiff, the e-diff mode of emacs, mdiff,
my Needs and my Imagination.
