Like every year, a Linux Expo is held in Paris. This year was at the
CNIT (La Defense), from Wed, 30. january 2002 to Fri 01 Februray 2002.
Last two years, I attended as a visitor. But this year, I wanted to be
part of it: I would be at the KDE booth.

So I took a day off. It is a pain to still have to wake-up early despite
the fact that you are on a day off :-). But, hey, KDE and the Linux Expo
is certainly worth it!

I arrived on the first day around 10:30. There was already David Faure,
Laurent Montel and the three members of the french translation team.
Stephan Westerfield was there too. He was invited by the Linux Expo to
present arts in the expensive conferences (150 euros for visitors). We
had two computers freshly installed with a Mandrake, with KDE2 and KDE3
(beta1). The computers were lend by Mandrake, they had top cool LCD
screens (which were lend by HP to Mandrake). Network was not working
:-(. We also had a gigantic K poster, and some cool KDE T-shirts to sell
(with the KDE3 splash screen), for 15 euros. The booth was given for
free by the Linux Expo, like for every Free Software organisation.

Surprisingly, the booth was close to the FSF booth. But the guys there
were cool (should I add "surprisingly" ?) and even KDE enthusiasts. In
fact, it turned out that they were not from the FSF (I knew this was not
natural :-) ). They only had put a product they had been developing in
partnership with Lotus under GPL, as a last step before closing their
self-funded company. According to them, the partnership with Lotus was
the main reason for their failure and they were extremly happy to
displease Lotus by putting their stuff under GPL. :-)

The other booth was the [AFUL](http://www.aful.org). AFUL, the *French
Association of Free software Users* is a very important association for
Linux in France. They are activly promoting Linux in the governement and
administrations, with success. And they are fighting software patents
with clever ideas. Last year, they [patented a software for the "35 hours"](http://aful.org/presse/pr-35h.html), (the *week of 35 hours* is
one of the major reform of the our governement), to demonstrate the
stupidity of the current patent system. I saw some top-AFUL members and
well-known french linux advocates, like Bernard Lang, Roberto Di Cosmo
or Stephane Fermigier.

I visited quickly the commercial booths. I found them even more
commercial than the previous years, all with ties and professional
presentation. Some companies their had nothing of the Free Software
spirit, some even sold a software they was patented! Hopefully, the true
companies were there too: O'Reilly, Mandrake, Alcove, ACT, some french
magazines, and so on. However, there was no Suse booth, no Gnome booth
and no Trolltech booth. A presentation of Qt was planned in the
afternoon, in the expensive conferences.

The Village of Associations was by far the most interesting thing, with
true hackers. I came back there, put my KDE uniform (the cool T-shirt)
and started to answer to the endless flow of visitors. It was not too
much crowded, unlike previous years.

-   My first Visitor: When is the KDE3 release planned ?
-   Me (thinking *shit, I can't remember*: uh, Laurent, do you know when
    the next released is planned exactly ?
-   Laurent: I think it is sometimes in march or february. Euh, David,
    do you know ? " :-))

Network was still not working but David knew, it was for end of march.
And a beta2 was under the cover, for monday.

The most often asked question was undoubtly *What's new in KDE3*. I also
didn't know (shit!). I had only tried KDE3 once or twice and was waiting
for the beta2 to switch. I couldn't say what was definitely new. But
Laurent and David confirmed that in fact, it was mostly background and
little changes so there was not much new to show to visitors.

I have probably answered the question a thousand times but I reproduce
it here, in case some people still don't know: *KDE 3 is binary
incompatible with KDE 2, hence the major version increment. All
applications and libraries have to be recompiled. But apart from that,
it could be labeled KDE 2.3. KDE 3 is quicker to launch, there is a new
educational package, Konqueror Javascript's support has been greatly
improved, support for right-to-left languages is better, there is some
improvement in the printing architecure, many bug fixes and many small
improvements that make your life easier.*

When I was too tired, I would answer differently:

-   What's new in KDE 3 ?
-   Nothing!

or

-   What's new in KDE 3 ?
-   Well, we rewrote everything in Gtk. In fact, Gtk is not that bad,
    you just have to like macros and struct.

and even

-   Some people believe we are increasing KDE version number because
    Gnome is finally reaching its version 2. They are absolutely right!
    :-)

We had the usual deal of clueless users, but not too much. My best
quotes:

-   *Do you sell Linux ?*
-   *My USB Palm Pilot is not working, do you know why ?*
-   *I installed the rpm of Brahms but it is not working!*. It turned
    out that the guy had installed a Suse rpm of Brahms for KDE 1.2 on
    his Mandrake 8.1. :-))) But he still pretended he hadn't use
    --force.

### Random remarks

-   Many visitors expressed their support to the KDE project.
-   Many many users use Konqueror as their browser of choice, even with
    other desktop.
-   All of the home users were using Mandrake, not even aware that there
    are some other distribution (*You know I am using a 8.1*). Mandrake
    is really very popular in France.
-   All the manager having a team developing with KDE (usually not very
    familiar with Free Software) were using Redhat and KDevelop.
-   I met three different people that were responsible to deploy Free
    Software inside their company and were investigating the existing
    solutions. Of course, I have pointed them to KDE Enterprise.
-   I saw at least three people willing to join the translation team.
    Some other were considering it.
-   I sold something like 8 KDE T-shirts. This is probably the booth top
    score :-)
-   Many people still believed Qt is not free! This is really a shame. I
    had to explain that it was in fact freeer that Gnome and Gtk and
    stuff like that.
-   I taught some 16 year old kids about the history of Linux, Gnu, the
    KDE / Gnome war.
-   I converted at least 3 people from Gtk to Qt. Mostly people starting
    development under Linux, thinking Gtk was the way to go. They even
    believed that it would work with C++. One of them had just bought a
    Gtk book but returned to the Eyrolles book store to change it :-))
    Remember, a Gtk program is bigger that the Qt equivalent.
-   Lot of coder are really using Gtk by default, finding it quite hard
    to use. They think Qt is not free or think Gtk is easier. What a
    pity!
-   I evangelised KDE and Qt a lot. Some told me I should work for
    Trolltech. :-) But Qt is simply better, cleaner, smoother than
    everything, perfectly documented, multi-platform and well-written.
    And KDE is just well organised, cleanly written, technically
    superior, professionally managed and developing at a faster pace
    than Gnome.
-   A guy from GnuStep came to discuss. Also of course, he finds KDE too
    much windows-like, he likes the project and the way it was handled.
    Gnome is really very messy and unorganised to him. I am glad not to
    be the only one to think that.

Discussing with David Faure, I told him about some complaints I had
about Konqueror : the profile setting should be in the settings menu and
the URL bar should accept URL drop by replacing the current URL. Then I
saw this magic thing: A live coding session by a true talented KDE core
developer : David took his laptop and started coding under my eyes. In
five minutes, it was done: the "URL" label would accept url and just
open them. Really great! He did that again on the next day, when a
visitor asked for the domtree plugin to support copy/paste of every
branch. Really great.

In the afternoon, Bruno Bellamy was on the AFUL booth, which was thus
overcrowded. Bruno Bellamy is a well known french drawer that makes
drawing for probably every french computer-related magazine. He draws
mainly cute girls with very few clothes and some penguins. The Demolinux
penguin is from him for example. If you don't know his work, you must
absolutely check his website,
[www.bellaminettes.com](http://www.bellaminettes.com) (french linke).

He was dedicating the Demolinux 3.0 CD and his drawings. If you don't
know Demolinux, you must absolutely discover it. This is a bootable
CDRom that will put you in a complete Linux environment, with KDE,
StarOffice, everything, without touching the hard disk. Demolinux is
perfect for people who want to have a look at linux but are afraid of
partionning or installing it. It is also very handy when you find
yourself in a windows-only place and you need some linux program. Check
the website : [www.demolinux.org](http://www.demolinux.org)

The end of the day came before I realised it was over. It's been great
for me to be able to share my passion for Free Software and KDE with the
many visitors and developers. I'll be there the next year for sure.

I work 20 minutes away from the CNIT, so I came back between 12 and 14
on thursday and friday (my boss didn't complain too much). I met Laurent
Rathle who is doing an incredible job on kde-france.org (now dead)

I found it very difficult to leave the booth to get back to office. KDE
and Free Software guys are really nice.
