# Homepage of Philippe Fremy (bluebird75 on GitHub)

This is a page to reflect about my life in the open source community.


## Open Source Software 

I am part of the Free and Open Source Software community since I discovered Linux in 1995.

### My Software

I have written the below free softwares:
* [MultiGit](https://github.com/idemia/multigit): A graphical interface for managing multiple nested git repositories. Developed as part of my work at IDEMIA and open sourced by IDEMIA.
* [LuaUnit](https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit): A unit-testing framework for the Lua language with more than 400k downloads.
* [Klotski](https://github.com/bluebird75/klotski): a mind-teaser game
* [Indent Finder](https://freehackers.org/bluebird/indent-finder): analyse source code indentation to set your editor automatically


### Software where I contribute

I am a contributor to the below softwares:
* Python static typing stubs for PyQt and Qt for Python:
  * [PySide6-stubs](https://github.com/python-qt-tools/PySide6-stubs): for PySide6 / Qt6 for Python
  * [PyQt5-stubs](https://github.com/python-qt-tools/PyQt5-stubs): for PyQt5
  * [PySide2-stubs](https://github.com/python-qt-tools/PySide2-stubs): for PySide2 / Qt5 for Python
* [pyannotate](https://github.com/bluebird75/pyannotate): I contributed the generation of Python 3 annotations, which was merged by Guido van Rossum (author of the Python language)
* [sxtool](https://github.com/bluebird75/sxtool): I maintain this nice tool to edit s-records files (used on embedded devices to load some binary data).

And of course, there are other smaller projects on my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bluebird75?tab=repositories)


## Conferences
I spoke at [PyParis 2018](http://pyparis.org/talks.html) on *Type Annotations with Python*. 

My slides are available here: [Powerpoint version](https://github.com/bluebird75/whoiam/blob/master/PyParis_2018/Type%20Annotations%20PyParis%202018%20-%20v4.pptx?raw=true) and [PDF Version](https://github.com/bluebird75/whoiam/raw/master/PyParis_2018/Type%20Annotations%20PyParis%202018%20-%20v4%20for%20pdf.pdf)

The [video of my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URP2e7hEUFw&list=PLzjFI0G5nSsry3cm_k1tPOi9SRaAXsZAt&index=6) has been published.

### Old Knowledge base

Pages about specific knowledge that I wrote for future reference:

* [Packaging a Python program](archives/Packaging_a_python_program)
* [Surviving on Windows](archives/Surviving_on_Windows) for linux freaks
* [Developing Free Software on Windows](archives/Developing_Free_Software_on_windows)


### Obsolete Software
This is software that I wrote, which is nowadays completely outdated, serve no longer any purpose and probably won't run
on any linux distribution. I keep them here for archeologists.
